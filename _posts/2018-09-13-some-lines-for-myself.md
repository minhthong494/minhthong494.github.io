## Lạc lối sau khi tốt nghiệp 
12/09/2018, one day after my second interview, I had a phone call from HR of X company announcing that I was failed. To be honest, this results did not suprised me much, I could guess my result once I left that interview room. The HRs asked me for the second opportunity to join the company by another interview with QC team. I refused her. At that time, I had a lit a big sad and nervous but I still believed I could find a better job. One day later, after a few chat with my friends, I decided to apply another position and at this time, the person who give a refusal was the HR. Her reason was that I was not fit with this position. I could feel every cold words she talked to me which means she was no longer want to hire me.
